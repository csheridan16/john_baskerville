    <p1>Paul Rosenbaum, or as he was more commonly known as ‘Paul Rand’ was an American art director and graphic designer who many considered to be the father of modern graphic design, named <I>"the greatest living graphic designer”</I> by none other than Apple founder Steve Jobs himself. Rand was the man who kick-started the idea that commercial art and design should have a strong visual appeal as well as a meaningful and functional role in the world of modern advertising as well as introducing a European style to American graphic design introducing themes from Bauhaus, Cubism, de Stijl, and Constructivism.  Rand is best known for his work in advertising and magazine work but most notably his corporate logos such as the logo for IBM, UPS, NeXT and Westinghouse to name a few.</p1>

<p2>Paul Rand was born <I>‘Peretz Rosenbaum’</I> in Brooklyn, New York in 1914. Paul’s religious beliefs as an Orthodox Jew forbade the creation of any images that could be seen to be worshiped as idols, meaning that Rand’s eventual career of creating icons to be used in the commercial world to be viewed by millions seemed as unlikely as any. However, this did not stop him, he began to design at a young age painting the sign for his father’s grocery shop as well as various paintings for school events despite the fact that Pauls father didn’t believe that art as a job could be an adequate occupation that could earn a good living. Paul attended Manhattans Haaren High school whilst at the same time took night classes at the Pratt Institute (a non profit institution that specialised in engineering, architecture, and the fine arts.) Rand also attended Parsons School of Design and the Art Students League but despite this he was largely a ‘self-taught’ designer, as Rand was dissatisfied with the schools approach to modern design. Instead, he decided to educate himself by learning about medium of graphic design and commercialism from what was coming out of Europe at the the time. Learning from magazines like Gebrauchsgraphik,(a magazine for promoting art in advertising) where he discovered the works of Adolphe Jean-Marie Mouron (a French painter, (a commercial poster artist, and typeface designer) as well as László Moholy-Nagy (a Hungarian painter and photographer,) Mouron and Moholy-Nagy are said to have been his biggest inspiration in these early years, he was also heavily inspired by the German advertising style Sachplakat (posters with bold eye-catching lettering with flat colors) as well as the works of Gustav Jensen.

<p3>Rand began to introduce this European inspiration to his work in American commercialism. Starting off with a part-time position designing stock images for a company that supplied graphics to various magazines and newspapers which he designed to be more eye catching rather than being bogged down with a ton of information, something that is still emulated in some modern magazines to this day. Between his work from Parsons School of Design and the Pratt Institute alongside his job, he was able to accumulate quite a large portfolio. By 1935, Rand was already considered to be one of the most forward-thinking designers of his generation. He was so successful that after a few years he demanded twice the pay for half his time, and got it, by the end of his career it was rumoured that he was earning upwards of £100,000 per commission. When Paul turned 21 he decided to change his own brand, so-to-speak, his name. ‘Peretz Rosenbaum,’ shortened his first name to Paul and took the name Rand after an uncle. Morris Wyszogrod, who was a close friend of Paul at the time, has stated that “he figured that four letters here, four letters there, would create a nice symbol,” especially when annotating his work. Peter Behrens( a German architect and important figure in the modernist movement) talks about how “Rand’s new persona, which served as the brand name for his many accomplishments, was the first corporate identity he created, and it may also eventually prove to be the most enduring.”</p3>

<p3>In 1936, at the age of 23, Rand was given the job of deciding how each page would look for an Apparel Arts (which is now known as GQ) magazine anniversary issue which earned him a full time job as the art director for Esquire-Coronet magazines. Like many artists at the time, Paul then decided to relocate to Madison Avenue, the centre for advertising in New York at the time. When Rand was age 27 in 1941 he was offered the role of Chief Art Director at the just newly founded ad agency William H. Weintraub & Co thanks to his radically different style in his past work, he, instead of cloaking an advert in the repetition of a generic image over and over again, as many did in that time, he chose to celebrate the ‘white space’ and treated each advertisement as its own truly unique piece of art rather than a chore that had to be completed.</p3>

    <p4>Rand’s most notable work throughout his career however is that of his logo design, many of which are still used today. Paul began his career in corporate identification in 1954 with the creation of the logo for IBM, one of the leading data processing companies in the world. Rand was specifically hand picked for the role by IBM’s president Thomas Watson Jr to design the logo, working alongside Eero Saarinen, Isamu Noguchi, and Ray Eames. However, this redesign didn’t just happen overnight. Rand’s first changes where subtle, changing the typeface and messed about with the letterforms, making the stacked squares in the ‘B’ larger, it took over a decade until Rand produced a design that he was happy with. He introduced the now iconic stripes into the logo in 1972 to suggest a sense of movement, this was not where his work stopped for IBM however. Rand also designed packaging and did marketing for IBM from the early 1970s until the early 1980s, including the ‘witty’ Eye-Bee-M poster in 1981 to commemorate IBM’s THINK campaign. It is also worth noting Rand produced variations of the logo, the company (under his guidance) played around with variations of the stripe pattern as well as the colours itself and Paul himself when designing the logo had two variations; the one with eight stripes was intended to be the default logo whereas he also designed a thirteen striped logo for when a more refined look was required e.g. business cards, stationary etc.</p4>

<p5>Paul the went on to design a logo that was ultimately not used for the motor company ‘Ford’ in the 1960s as well as the logo for abc (American broadcasting company) which proves Rand’s theory that a logo <I>“cannot survive unless it is designed with the utmost simplicity and restraint.”</I>He also designed the UPS (united parcel service) logo which sadly has been since upgraded but still retains some of Rand’s original qualities like the brown colour, which more or less defines the brand ‘shipping brown,’ and exists in everything from their uniforms to delivery vans today. And one of his final logos was when he worked alongside fellow legend Steve Jobs, co-founder of tech conglomerate Apple. Jobs branched off from apple in the early days (but later returned) in an attempt to corner the education sector within the computer industry, founding another company called NeXT. Steve jobs called Paul Rand one of the most professional people he has ever and will ever work with, he asked Paul to present a few possibilities however Paul presented him with one saying <I>“No, I will solve the problem for you, and you will pay me. You don’t have to use the solution; if you want options, go talk to other people. But I’ll solve the problem for you.”</I></p5>

    <p6>Rand devoted his later life to design work, writing books detailing his work and the meaning of it. Rand was also a professor of graphic design at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut from 1956 to 1969, and from 1974 to 1985. Sadly he died of cancer on November 26th, 1996, and is buried in Beth El Cemetery In Norwalk, Los Angeles.

<P7>When I began to research each artist to make my decision on which artist I would base my website on, Paul Rand’s work spiked my interest. Rand’s work was simplistic but yet effective it was all it needed to be and nothing more, as he said “ideas do not need to be esoteric to be original or exciting,” meaning work does not need to be overly-complicated to be effective. Rand worked with some of the biggest names in America throughout his career and made a huge impact on the world of design itself, his Influence is still felt today with the IBM logo remaining unchanged over 50 years from its initial design. Paul introduced European ideas about graphic design into American design and paved the way for modern graphic deigners. Teaching many that as long as the design is distinctive, memorable, and clear it will stand the test of time.
